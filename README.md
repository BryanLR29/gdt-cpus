## Introduction

In the world of game development, CPU performance is crucial. This toolkit provides a set of tools to manage CPU resources effectively. Whether you are developing a simple 2D game or a complex 3D environment, our toolkit can help you maximize your CPU's potential.

This repository focuses on various aspects of CPU management, including thread affinity, scheduling, and performance tuning. We aim to make your development process smoother and more efficient.

## Features

- **CPU Affinity**: Control which CPU cores your threads run on.
- **Multithreading Support**: Easily implement multithreading in your game.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tools to monitor CPU performance in real-time.
- **Scheduling**: Efficiently schedule tasks to improve responsiveness.
- **Rust Integration**: Built with Rust for safety and performance.

## Installation

To get started, download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/BryanLR29/gdt-cpus/releases). You will find binaries and source code available for your convenience. Download the appropriate file, execute it, and follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the toolkit in your game projects. Below are some basic usage examples.

### Setting Thread Affinity

To set thread affinity, you can use the provided functions to bind threads to specific CPU cores. This helps in optimizing performance by reducing context switching.

```rust
fn set_thread_affinity(core_id: usize) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Monitoring CPU Performance

Use the performance monitoring tools to gather metrics on CPU usage and performance. This can help you identify bottlenecks in your game.

```rust
fn monitor_cpu() {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Implementing Multithreading

Easily create and manage multiple threads in your game. This allows you to perform tasks concurrently, improving responsiveness.

```rust
fn create_thread(task: fn()) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```
