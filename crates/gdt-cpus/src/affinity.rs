//! Manages thread affinity and priority for the current thread.
//!
//! This module provides functions to control which CPU cores a thread runs on
//! (`pin_thread_to_core`) and to set the scheduling priority of the current thread
//! (`set_thread_priority`). These operations are often crucial in game development
//! for optimizing performance and ensuring that critical tasks receive sufficient
//! CPU resources.
//!
//! The behavior of these functions is platform-specific, with implementations
//! provided for Windows, Linux, and macOS. For unsupported platforms, a
//! `Error::Unsupported` will be returned.
//!
//! It also provides a way to retrieve a default set of scheduling policies via
//! `get_scheduling_policies`.

/// Pins the current thread to a specific logical core ID.
///
/// This function attempts to set the CPU affinity for the currently executing thread
/// to the specified logical core. Logical core IDs are OS-specific.
/// You can get a list of all logical core IDs using `cpu_info().logical_processor_ids()`.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// *   `logical_core_id`: The OS-specific ID of the logical core to pin the thread to.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// *   `Ok(())` if the thread was successfully pinned.
/// *   `Err(Error)` if pinning failed. This could be due to an invalid `logical_core_id`,
///     insufficient permissions, or if the operation is unsupported on the current platform.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use gdt_cpus::{pin_thread_to_core, cpu_info};
///
/// // Attempt to pin the current thread to the first available logical core.
/// if let Ok(info) = cpu_info() {
///     if let Some(first_core_id) = info.logical_processor_ids().first() {
///         match pin_thread_to_core(*first_core_id) {
